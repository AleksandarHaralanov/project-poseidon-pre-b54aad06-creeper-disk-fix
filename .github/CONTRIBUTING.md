## Coding Conventions
This is an open-source project. Keep in mind the people who will read your code â€” make it clean and easy to understand.

When reading the code, you'll quickly get the hang of it. Focus on optimizing for readability:

- Do not leave zombie code behind.
- If you feel the need to add comments, don't hesitate; they are always appreciated.
- Use an indentation of four spaces whenever possible; however, two spaces are also acceptable if preferred.
- Always include spaces after list items and method parameters (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (e.g., `x += 1`, not `x+=1`), around hash arrows, curly braces etc.
- Avoid utilizing algorithms with bad space and time complexity.
    - You can read more about Big O notation [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation).

Following general coding conventions is recommended as a best practice, no matter what you are working on.
